## Introducing coursedown

Build your R-based course websites with this IHEID themed course website template
and `{blogdown}`! Thought as a companion to the excellent
[`{iheiddown}`](https://github.com/jhollway/iheiddown) package,
`{coursedown}` cuts down the time you'll need to publish a fully functional
course website to share R code with your students to an hour or two!

## Getting started

Getting started with `{coursedown}` is as simple as hitting the
"Use this template" button above and creating your own repository. The only
thing left to do then is to head over to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
to deploy your site. This will take no more than **15 minutes**! For
an illustrated walk-through, head over to the website to find a
detailed [user guide](https://coursedown.netlify.app/courses/userguide/) and
check out the various possibilities the theme offers!

## Open an issue

Bug reports and suggestions for improvements are welcome! Simply [create an
issue](https://github.com/BBieri/coursedown/issues) on GitHub and explain
your issue :)
