## A gentle hands-on introduction

We live in a digital society, and enormous amounts of textual data are
generated every day. Text analysis for social science research is not
new, but with recent computational advances, we can now process text
much more efficiently and in greater quantity.

Quantitative text analysis is a set of tools that help make sense of
textual data by systematically extracting information from texts. This
workshop will teach you the fundamentals of quantitative text analysis
and provide you with hands-on experience with cutting-edge methods
implemented in R.

The workshop covers important basics (e.g., pre-processing,
tokenization, and part-of-speech tagging) as well as three types of
analytic techniques: rule-based, unsupervised, and supervised methods
(dictionary methods, topic models and machine learning, respectively).

By the end of this workshop, participants will have a good understanding
of the potentials and limitations of quantitative text analysis, as well
as some experience working with the R software packages for conducting
this type of analysis.
