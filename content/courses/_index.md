You can add additional resources for students here. The premise of this section
is to provide them with resources on *how* to learn programming by showcasing
useful resources, giving tips, or creating cheatsheets. In this demo version
of the site, you'll also find a user guide to guide you in the process of
adapting this base site to suit the needs of your course.
