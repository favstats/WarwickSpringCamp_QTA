*   The Washington Post's ["demographic tug-of-war"](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/2016-election/the-demographic-groups-fueling-the-election/) visualization is a lovely illustration of how _**not**_ to appropriately use color saturation and hue to encode information, and **also** has misleading axes (both in unit spacing and direction)!
*   The New York Times' interactive ["The 1,024 Ways Clinton or Trump Can Win the Election"](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/upshot/clinton-trump-paths-to-win-election.html) is a great use of interactivity as a data exploration tool.
*   Also from the NYT, ["Your Surgeon Is Probably a Republican, Your Psychiatrist Probably a Democrat"](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/07/upshot/your-surgeon-is-probably-a-republican-your-psychiatrist-probably-a-democrat.html?smprod=nytcore-iphone&smid=nytcore-iphone-share&_r=1) makes excellent use of a graphs and charts to tell a very clear story. Also note their detailed description at the end of the article of how the data were collected!
*   The Washington Post's ["One Hundred Years of Hurricanes"](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/national/one-hundred-years-of-hurricanes/?%3Ftid%3D=sm_pg) is a nice example of small-multiples cartography along with color.
*   The New York Times' ["What Good Marathons and Bad Investments Have in Common"](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/23/upshot/what-good-marathons-and-bad-investments-have-in-common.html) illustrates a good use of contrast and preattentive processing (plus is a very interesting story!).
*   From Our World In Data, a nice example of using color and saturation to highlight certain information, in a terrifying plot about [Life Expectancy vs. Health Expenditure Over Time](https://ourworldindata.org/the-link-between-life-expectancy-and-health-spending-us-focus#life-expectancy-vs-health-expenditure-over-time-1970-2014ref).
*   [Myriahedral map projections](http://www.win.tue.nl/%7Evanwijk/myriahedral/) are interesting.
*   [Tilegrams](http://pitchinteractive.com/latest/tilegrams-more-human-maps/) are a good alternative to a cartogram.
*   We do not recommend making bivariate chloropleth maps, but if you _must_, [here's a good tutorial](http://www.joshuastevens.net/cartography/make-a-bivariate-choropleth-map/) on how to do it and what some of the considerations are.
