This user guide will take you through the various possibilities that this
blogdown template provides you with and how to adapt it to your course. The
template was inspired by two other excellent blogdown sites:
[Alison Hill's "Sharing on short notice"](https://rstudio-education.github.io/sharing-short-notice/#1) and
[Andrew Heiss' Program Evaluation course](https://evalsp21.classes.andrewheiss.com/) and the present
version of the demo site contains "lab pages" from Alison Hill's site. These are only included for showcasing
the possibilities of the site and will be replaced in the coming weeks.

After this quick introduction of the website, navigate to the first page of the
course to learn how to set up your own project. Let's get started!
