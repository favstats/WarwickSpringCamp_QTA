"This platform is dedicated with appreciation and reverence for:",NA,NA
"Preamble",NA,NA
"The 2012 Republican Platform is a statement of who we are and what we believe as a Party","305",NA
"and our vision for a stronger and freer America.","601",NA
"The pursuit of opportunity has defined America from our very beginning.","601",NA
"This is a land of opportunity.","601",NA
"The American Dream is a dream of equal opportunity for all.","503",NA
"And the Republican Party is the party of opportunity.","305",NA
"Today, that American Dream is at risk.","601",NA
"Our nation faces unprecedented uncertainty with great fiscal and economic challenges,","408",NA
"and under the current Administration has suffered through the longest and most severe economic downturn since the Great Depression.","408",NA
"Many Americans have experienced the burden of lost jobs, lost homes, and lost hopes.","000",NA
"Our middle class has felt that burden most acutely.","704",NA
"Meanwhile, the federal government has expanded its size and scope, its borrowing and spending, its debt and deficit.","000",NA
"Federalism is threatened","301",NA
"and liberty retreats.","201",NA
"For the world, this has been four years of lost American leadership,","601",NA
"leadership that depends upon economic vitality","408",NA
"and peace through strength.","106",NA
"Put simply: The times call for trustworthy leadership and honest talk about the challenges we face.","000",NA
"Our nation and our people cannot afford the status quo.","305",NA
"We must begin anew, with profound changes in the way government operates;","305",NA
"the way it budgets, taxes, and regulates.","303",NA
"Jefferson’s vision of a “wise and frugal government” must be restored.","601",NA
"Providence has put us at the fork in the road, and we must answer the question: If not us, who?","305",NA
"If not now, when?","305",NA
"That is the choice facing the American people this November.","305",NA
"Every voter will be asked to choose between the chronic high unemployment and the unsustainable debt produced by a big government entitlement society,","000",NA
"or a positive, optimistic view of an opportunity society, where any American who works hard, dreams big and follows the rules can achieve anything he or she wants.","401",NA
"The American people possess vast reserves of courage and determination and the capacity to hear the truth and chart a strong course.","601",NA
"They are eager for the opportunity to take on life’s challenges and, through faith and hard work, transform the future for the better.","601",NA
"They are the most generous people on earth, giving sacrificially of their time, talent, and treasure.","601",NA
"This platform affirms that America has always been a place of grand dreams and even grander realities;","601",NA
"and so it will be again, if we return government to its proper role, making it smaller and smarter.","303",NA
"If we restructure government’s most important domestic programs to avoid their fiscal collapse.","303",NA
"If we keep taxation, litigation, and regulation to a minimum.","401",NA
"If we celebrate success, entrepreneurship, and innovation.","401",NA
"If we lift up the middle class.","704",NA
"If we hand over to the next generation a legacy of growth and prosperity,","410",NA
"rather than entitlements and indebtedness.","401",NA
"That same commitment must be present both here at home and abroad.","601",NA
"We are a party that knows the difference between international acclaim and world leadership.","107",NA
"We will lift the torch of freedom and democracy to inspire all those who would be free.","202",NA
"As President Reagan issued the clarion call to “tear down this Wall,” so must we always stand against tyranny and oppression.","201",NA
"We will always support and cherish our men and women in uniform who defend our liberties with their lives.","104",NA
"As we embark upon this critical mission, we are not without guidance.","000",NA
"We possess an owner’s manual: the Constitution of the United States, the greatest political document ever written.","203",NA
"That sacred document shows us the path forward.","203",NA
"Trust the people.","202",NA
"Limit government.","303",NA
"Respect federalism.","301",NA
"Guarantee opportunity, not outcomes.","401",NA
"Adhere to the rule of law.","605",NA
"Reaffirm that our rights come from God,","703",NA
"are protected by government,","703",NA
"and that the only just government is one that truly governs with the consent of the governed.","202",NA
"The principles written in the Constitution are secured by the character of the American people.","601",NA
"President George Washington said in his first inaugural address: “The propitious smiles of Heaven can never be expected on a nation that disregards the eternal rules of order and right which Heaven itself has ordained.”","000",NA
"Values matter.","603",NA
"Character counts.","601",NA
"Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan understand these great truths.","305",NA
"They share a positive vision for America – a vision of America renewed and strong.","305",NA
"They know America’s best days lay ahead.","601",NA
"It will take honest results oriented, conservative leadership to enact good policies for our people.","305",NA
"They will provide it.","305",NA
"We respectfully submit this platform to the American people.","000",NA
"It is both a vision of where we are headed and an invitation to join us in that journey.","305",NA
"It is about the great dreams and opportunities that have always been America","601",NA
"and must remain the essence of America for generations to come.","601",NA
"May God continue to shed his grace on the United States of America.","603",NA

"Restoring the American Dream: Rebuilding the Economy and Creating Jobs",NA,NA
"We are the party of maximum economic freedom and the prosperity freedom makes possible.","401",NA
"Prosperity is the product of selfdiscipline, work, savings, and investment by individual Americans,","401",NA
"but it is not an end in itself.","000",NA
"Prosperity provides the means by which individuals and families can maintain their independence from government,","000",NA
"raise their children by their own values,","603",NA
"practice their faith,","603",NA
"and build communities of selfreliant neighbors.","606",NA
"It is also the means by which the United States is able to assert global leadership.","107",NA
"The vigor of our economy makes possible our military strength","410",NA
"and is critical to our national security.","104",NA
"This year’s election is a chance to restore the proven values of the American free enterprise system.","401",NA
"We offer our Republican vision of a free people using their Godgiven talents, combined with hard work, selfreliance, ethical conduct, and the pursuit of opportunity, to achieve great things for themselves and the greater community.","601",NA
"Our vision of an opportunity society stands in stark contrast to the current Administration’s policies that expand entitlements and guarantees,","305",NA
"create new public programs,","505",NA
"and provide expensive government bailouts.","401",NA
"That road has created a culture of dependency,","505",NA
"bloated government,","000",NA
"and massive debt.","414",NA
"Republicans believe in the Great American Dream, with its economics of inclusion, enabling everyone to have a chance to own, invest, build, and prosper.","601",NA
"It is the opposite of the policies which, for the last three and a half years, have stifled growth, destroyed jobs, halted investment, created unprecedented uncertainty, and prolonged the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression.","305",NA
"Those policies have placed the federal government in the driver’s seat,","301",NA
"rather than relying on energetic and entrepreneurial Americans to rebuild the economy from the ground up.","401",NA
"Excessive taxation and regulation impede economic development.","401",NA
"Lowering taxes promotes substantial economic growth","410",NA
"and reducing regulation encourages business formation and job creation.","401",NA
"Knowing that, a Republican President and Congress will jumpstart an economic renewal that creates opportunity,","408",NA
"rewards work and saving,","414",NA
"and unleashes the productive genius of the American people.","410",NA
"Because the GOP is the Great Opportunity Party, this is our pledge to workers without jobs,","701",NA
"families without savings,","603",NA
"and neighborhoods without hope:","606",NA
"together we can get our country back on track,","305",NA
"expanding its bounty,","601",NA
"renewing its faith,","603",NA
"and fulfilling its promise of a better life.","503",NA
"Job Creation: Getting Americans Back to Work",NA,NA
"The best jobs program is economic growth.","410",NA
"We do not offer yet another madeinWashington package of subsidies and spending to create temporary or artificial jobs.","401",NA
"We want much more than that.","408",NA
"We want a roaring job market to match a roaring economy.","701",NA
"Instead, what this Administration has given us is 42 consecutive months of unemployment above 8 percent, the longest period of high unemployment since the Great Depression.","701",NA
"Republicans will pursue free market policies that are the surest way to boost employment","401",NA
"and create job growth and economic prosperity for all.","410",NA
"In all the sections that follow, as well as elsewhere in this platform, we explain what must be done to achieve that goal.","000",NA
"The tax system must be simplified.","303",NA
"Government spending and regulation must be reined in.","401",NA
"American companies must be more competitive in the world market,","407",NA
"and we must be aggressive in promoting U.S. products abroad and securing open markets for them.","407",NA
"A federalStateprivate partnership must invest in the nation’s infrastructure: roads, bridges, airports, ports, and water systems, among others.","411",NA
"Federal training programs have to be overhauled and made relevant for the workplace of the twentyfirst century.","411",NA
"Potential employers need certainty and predictability for their hiring decisions,","408",NA
"and the team of a Republican President and Congress will create the confidence that will get Americans back to work.","701",NA
"Small Business and Entrepreneurship",NA,NA
"America’s small businesses are the backbone of the U.S. economy, employing tens of millions of workers.","402",NA
"Small businesses create the vast majority of jobs, patents, and U.S. exporters.","402",NA
"Under the current Administration, we have the lowest rate of business startups in thirty years.","305",NA
"Small businesses are the leaders in the world’s advances in technology and innovation,","411",NA
"and we pledge to strengthen that role and foster small business entrepreneurship.","402",NA
"While small businesses have significantly contributed to the nation’s economic growth, our government has failed to meet its small business goals year after year","410",NA
"and failed to overcome burdensome regulatory, contracting, and capital barriers.","401",NA
"This impedes their growth.","410",NA
"We will reform the tax code to allow businesses to generate enough capital to grow and create jobs for our families, friends and neighbors all across America.","402",NA
"We will encourage investments in small businesses.","402",NA
"We will create an environment where adequate financing and credit are available to spur manufacturing and expansion.","402",NA
"We will serve as aggressive advocates for small businesses.","408",NA
"Tax Relief to Grow the Economy and Create Jobs",NA,NA
"Taxes, by their very nature, reduce a citizen’s freedom.","201",NA
"Their proper role in a free society should be to fund services that are essential and authorized by the Constitution, such as national security,","203",NA
"and the care of those who cannot care for themselves.","705",NA
"We reject the use of taxation to redistribute income,","401",NA
"fund unnecessary or ineffective programs,","303",NA
"or foster the crony capitalism that corrupts both politicians and corporations.","304",NA
"Our goal is a tax system that is simple, transparent, flatter, and fair.","303",NA
"In contrast, the current IRS code is like a patchwork quilt, stitched together over time from mismatched pieces, and is beyond the comprehension of the average citizen.","303",NA
"A reformed code should promote simplicity and coherence,","303",NA
"savings and innovation,","414",NA
"increase American competitiveness,","407",NA
"and recognize the burdens on families with children.","603",NA
"To that end, we propose to:Extend  the  2001  and  2003  tax  relief packages—commonly  known  as  the  Bush  tax cuts—pending   reform  of  the  tax  code;","402",NA
",  to  keep tax  rates  from  rising  on  income,  interest,  dividends,  and  capital  gains","401",NA
"Reform  the  tax  code  by  reducing  marginal tax  rates  by  20  percent  acrosstheboard  in  a revenueneutral  manner;","401",NA
"Eliminate  the  taxes  on  interest,  dividends, and  capital  gains  altogether  for  lower  and middleincome  taxpayers;","401",NA
"End  the  Death  Tax;  ","401",NA
"and Repeal  the  Alternative  Minimum  Tax.","401",NA
"American Competitiveness in a Global Economy",NA,NA
"American businesses now face the world’s highest corporate tax rate.","402",NA
"It reduces their worldwide competitiveness,","410",NA
"encourages corporations to move overseas,","406",NA
"lessens investment,","410",NA
"cripples job creation,","701",NA
"lowers U.S. wages,","701",NA
"and fosters the avoidance of tax liability—without actually increasing tax revenues.","408",NA
"To level the international playing field, and to spur job creation here at home, we call for a reduction of the corporate rate to keep U.S. corporations competitive internationally,","402",NA
"with a permanent research and development tax credit,","411",NA
"and a repeal of the corporate alternative minimum tax.","402",NA
"We also support the recommendation of the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, as well as the current President’s Export Council, to switch to a territorial system of corporate taxation,  so that profits earned and taxed abroad may be repatriated for jobcreating investment here at home without additional penalty.","410",NA
"Fundamental Tax Principles",NA,NA
"We oppose retroactive taxation;","401",NA
"and we condemn attempts by activist judges, at any level of government, to seize the power of the purse by ordering higher taxes.","401",NA
"We oppose tax policies that divide Americans or promote class warfare.","503",NA
"Because of the vital role of religious organizations, charities, and fraternal benevolent societies in fostering benevolence and patriotism, they should not be subject to taxation, and donations to them should continue to be tax deductible.","603",NA
"In any restructuring of federal taxation, to guard against hypertaxation of the American people, any value added tax or national sales tax must be tied to the simultaneous repeal of the Sixteenth Amendment, which established the federal income tax.","204",NA
"Reining in OutofControl Spending, Balancing the Budget, and Ensuring Sound Monetary Policy",NA,NA
"The  massive  federal  government  is  structurally and  financially  broken.","414",NA
" For  decades  it  has  been pushed  beyond  its  core  functions,  increasing  spending  to  unsustainable  levels.","414",NA
" Elected  officials  have overpromised  and  overspent,  and  now  the  bills  are due.","414",NA
" Unless  we  take  dramatic  action  now,  young Americans  and  their  children  will  inherit  an  unprecedented  legacy  of  enormous  and  unsustainable  debt, with  the  interest  alone  consuming  an  everincreasing portion  of  the  country’s  wealth.","414",NA
"The  specter  of  national  bankruptcy  that  now  hangs  over  much of  Europe  is  a  warning  to  us  as well.","110",NA
" Over  the  last  three  and  a half  years,  while  cutting  the  deflfense  budget,  the  current  Admincoistration  has  added  an  additional $5.3  trillion  to  the  national debt—now  approximately  $16 trillion,  the  largest  amount  in U.S.  history.","305",NA
" In  fiscal  year  2011, spending  reached  $3.6  trillion, nearly  a  quarter  of  our  gross  domestic  product.","414",NA
" Adjusted  for  inflation,  that’s  more  than  three times  its  peak  level  in  World  War  II","414",NA
",  and  almost  half of  every  dollar  spent  was  borrowed  money.  ","414",NA
"Three programs—Medicare,  Medicaid,  and  Social  Security—  account  for  over  40  percent  of  total  spending.","505",NA
"While  these  levels  of  spending  and  debt  are  already harming  job  creation  and  growth,  projections  of  future  spending  growth  are  nothing  short  of  catastrophic,  both  economically  and  socially.  ","414",NA
"And  those dire  projections  do  not  include  the  fiscal  nightmare of  Obamacare,  with  over  $1  trillion  in  new  taxes,  multiple  mandates,  and  a  crushing  price  tag.","505",NA
"We can preempt the debt explosion.","414",NA
"Backed by a Republican Senate and House, our next President will propose immediate reductions in federal spending,","414",NA
"as a down payment on the much larger task of longrange fiscal control.","414",NA
"We suggest a tripartite test for every federal activity.","000",NA
"First, is it within the constitutional scope of the federal government?","203",NA
"Second, is it effective and absolutely necessary?","401",NA
"And third, is it sufficiently important to justify borrowing, especially foreign borrowing, to fund it?","414",NA
"Against those standards we will measure programs from international population control to California’s federally subsidized highspeed train to nowhere, and terminate programs that don’t measure up.","303",NA
"Balancing the Budget",NA,NA
"Cutting spending is not enough;","414",NA
"it must be accompanied by major structural reforms,","414",NA
"increased productivity,","410",NA
"use of technology,","411",NA
"and longterm government downsizing","303",NA
"that both reduce debt and deficits","414",NA
"and ignite economic growth.","410",NA
"We must restructure the twentieth  century  entitlement state","505",NA
" so  the  missions  of  important  programs  can  succeed  in  the twentyfirst  century.","504",NA
" Medicare, in  particular,  is  the  largest  driver of  future  debt.  ","505",NA
"Our  reform  of healthcare  will  empower  millions  of  seniors  to  control  their personal  healthcare  decisions,","505",NA
"unlike  Obamacare  that  empowered  a  handful  of  bureaucrats  to cut  Medicare  in  ways  that  will deny  care  for  the  elderly.","505",NA
"We  must  also  change  the budget  process  itself.","414",NA
"  From  its  beginning,  its  design has  enabled,  rather  than  restrained,  reckless  spending  by  giving  procedural  cover  to  Members  of  Congress.","414",NA
" The  budget  process  gave  us  the  insidious  term “tax  expenditure,”  which  means  that  any  earnings  the government  allows  a  taxpayer  to  keep  through  a  deduction,  exemption,  or  credit  are  equivalent  to spending  the  same  amount  on  some  program. ","414",NA
"It  also lumped  a  broad  range  of  diverse  programs  under  the heading  of  “entitlement,”  as  if  veterans’  benefits   and welfare  checks  belong  in  the  same  category.","505",NA
" Far worse,  the  process  assumes  every  spending  program will  be  permanent  and  every  tax  cut  will  be  temporary.","414",NA
" It  refuses  to  recognize  the  beneficial  budgetary impact  of  lower  tax  rates,","401",NA
" and  it  calls  a  spending  increase a cut if it is less than the rate of inflation.","414",NA
"Republican  Members  of  Congress  have  repeatedly  tried  to  reform  the  budget  process  to  make  it more  transparent  and  accountable,  in  particular  by voting  for  a  Balanced  Budget  Amendment  to  the  Constitution,","303",NA
" following  the  lead  of  33  States  which  have put  that  restraint  into  their  own  constitutions.","204",NA
" We call  for  a  Constitutional  amendment  requiring  a supermajority  for  any  tax  increase,  with  exceptions for  only  war  and  national  emergencies,  ","204",NA
"and  imposing a  cap  limiting  spending  to  the  historical  average percentage  of  GDP  so  that  future  Congresses  cannot balance  the  budget  by  raising  taxes.","414",NA
" ",NA,NA
"Inflation and the Federal Reserve",NA,NA
"A sound monetary policy is critical for maintaining a strong economy.","414",NA
"Inflation diminishes the purchasing power of the dollar at home and abroad and is a hidden tax on the American people.","414",NA
"Moreover, the inflation tax is regressive","401",NA
", punishes those who save,","414",NA
"transfers wealth from Main Street to Wall Street,","401",NA
"and has grave implications for seniors living on fixed incomes.","706",NA
"Because the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy actions affect both inflation and economic activity, those actions should be transparent.","303",NA
"Moreover, the Fed’s important role as a lender of last resort should also be carried out in a more transparent manner.","303",NA
"A free society demands that the sun shine on all elements of government.","201",NA
"Therefore, the Republican Party will work to advance substantive legislation that brings transparency and accountability to the Federal Reserve, the Federal Open Market Committee, and the Fed’s dealings with foreign central banks.","303",NA
"The first step to increasing transparency and accountability is through an annual audit of the Federal Reserve’s activities.","303",NA
"Such an audit would need to be carefully implemented so that the Federal Reserve remains insulated from political pressures","304",NA
"and so its decisions are based on sound economic principles and sound money rather than on political pressures for easy money and loose credit.","408",NA
"Determined to crush the doubledigit inflation that was part of the Carter Administration’s economic legacy, President Reagan, shortly after his inauguration, established a commission to consider the feasibility of a metallic basis for U.S. currency.","414",NA
"The commission advised against such a move.","000",NA
"Now, three decades later, as we face the task of cleaning up the wreckage of the current Administration’s policies, we propose a similar commission to investigate possible ways to set a fixed value for the dollar.","414",NA
"Ending the Housing Crisis and Expanding Opportunities for Homeownership",NA,NA
"Homeownership expands personal liberty, builds communities, and helps Americans create wealth.","401",NA
"“The American Dream” is not a stale slogan.","601",NA
"It is the lived reality that expresses the aspirations of all our people.","601",NA
"It means a decent place to live,","606",NA
"a safe place to raise kids,","605",NA
"a welcoming place to retire.","606",NA
"It bespeaks the quiet pride of those who work hard to shelter their family and, in the process, create caring neighborhoods.","606",NA
"Homeownership is best fostered by a growing economy with low interest rates,","410",NA
"as well as prudent regulation, financial education, and targeted assistance to responsible borrowers.","402",NA
"The collapse of the housing market over the last four years has been not only a severe blow to the entire economy, but also a personal tragedy to millions of Americans whose homes have lost value and to so many others who have lost their homes.","408",NA
"Combined with high unemployment, that decline has left countless homeowners saddled with mortgages exceeding the value of their homes.","408",NA
"The response of the current Administration has done little to improve, and much to worsen, the situation.","305",NA
"By discouraging private sector investment, it has stalled the housing recovery.","305",NA
"Its massive intervention in the housing market, with the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac backing nearly all new mortgages, has hit the taxpayers with a bill for almost $200 billion to bail out the latter two institutions.","401",NA
"It has spent billions more on poorly designed and ineffective housing assistance programs.","504",NA
"Making matters worse, the Congress, under Democrat control, enacted the DoddFrank Act, a massive labyrinth of costly new regulations that deter lenders from lending to creditworthy homebuyers","303",NA
"and that disproportionately harms small and community banks.","401",NA
"As a result, home sales remain weak, investment in housing remains depressed, construction industry jobs remain down, and mortgage lending has yet to recover to precrisis levels.","410",NA
"Rebuilding Homeownership",NA,NA
"We must establish a mortgage finance system based on competition and free enterprise that is transparent,","401",NA
"encourages the private sector to return to housing,","401",NA
"and promotes personal responsibility on the part of borrowers.","401",NA
"Policies that promote reliance on private capital, like private mortgage insurance, will be critical to scaling back the federal role in the housing market","401",NA
"and avoiding future taxpayer bailouts.","401",NA
"Reforms should provide clear and prudent underwriting standards and guidelines on acceptable lending practices.","303",NA
"Compliance with regulatory standards should provide a legal safe harbor to guard against opportunistic litigation.","402",NA
"Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were a primary cause of the housing crisis because their implicit government guarantee allowed them to avoid market discipline and make risky investments.","403",NA
"Their favored political status enriched their politicallyconnected executives and their shareholders at the expense of the nation.","403",NA
"Both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac should be wound down in size and scope, and their officials should be held to account.","403",NA
"The FHA, tripled in size to more than $1 trillion under the current Administration, has crowded out the private sector and is at risk of requiring a taxpayer bailout.","303",NA
"It must be downsized","303",NA
"and limited to helping firsttime homebuyers and lowand moderateincome borrowers.","504",NA
"Taxpayer dollars should not be used to bail out borrowers and lenders by funding principal writedowns.","408",NA
"While the federal government must prosecute mortgage fraud and other financial crimes, any settlements received thereby should be directed to individuals harmed by the misconduct, not diverted to pay for unrelated programs.","401",NA
"FDIC insurance for bank depositors must be preserved.","414",NA
"However, to correct for the moral hazard created by deposit insurance, banks should be well capitalized, which is the best insurance against future taxpayer bailouts.","408",NA
"The federal government has a role in housing by enforcing nondiscrimination laws and assisting lowincome families and the elderly with safe and adequate shelter, especially through the use of housing vouchers.","503",NA
"Homeownership is an important goal, but public policy must be balanced to reflect the needs of Americans who choose to rent.","504",NA
"A comprehensive housing policy should address the demand for apartments and multifamily housing.","504",NA
"Any assistance should be subject to stringent oversight to ensure that funds are spent wisely.","303",NA
"Infrastructure: Building the Future",NA,NA
"America’s infrastructure networks are critical for economic growth,","410",NA
"international competitiveness,","406",NA
"and national security.","104",NA
"Infrastructure programs have traditionally been nonpartisan; everyone recognized that we all need clean water and safe roads, rail, bridges, ports, and airports.","411",NA
"The current Administration has changed that, replacing civil engineering with social engineering as it pursues an exclusively urban vision of dense housing and government transit.","401",NA
"In the vaunted stimulus package, less than six percent of the funds went to transportation,","411",NA
"with most of that to cosmetic “shovelready” projects rather than fundamental structural improvements.","411",NA
"All the while, the Democrats’ DavisBacon law continues to drive up infrastructure construction and maintenance costs for the benefit of that party’s union stalwarts.","702",NA
"What most Americans take for granted—the safety and availability of our water supply—is in perilous condition.","411",NA
"Engineering surveys report crumbling drinking water systems, aging dams, and overwhelmed wastewater infrastructure.","411",NA
"Investment in these areas, as well as with levees and inland waterways, can renew communities, attract businesses, and create jobs.","411",NA
"Most importantly, it can assure the health and safety of the American people.","411",NA
"The nation’s ports have become a bottleneck in international trade.","411",NA
"America’s exporters sometimes use Canadian ports in order to reach the world market in a timely manner.","411",NA
"With the widening of the Panama Canal, our East Coast and Gulf ports have an extraordinary opportunity to boost container traffic","411",NA
"but require major improvement to remain competitive receivers of large vessels.","411",NA
"Interstate infrastructure has long been a federal responsibility shared with the States,","301",NA
"and a renewed federalState partnership and new publicprivate partnerships are urgently needed to maintain and modernize our country’s travel lifelines","301",NA

"It is a return to the principles of federalism, and it contains not a single earmark.","301",NA

"The Free Trade Agreements negotiated with friendly democracies since President Reagan’s trailblazing pact with Israel in 1985 facilitated the creation of nearly ten million jobs supported by our exports.","407",NA
"That record makes all the more deplorable the current Administration’s slowness in completing agreements begun by its predecessor","305",NA

"The current Administration’s open defiance of this constitutional principle—in its handling of immigration cases, in federal personnel benefits, in allowing a samesex marriage at a military base, and in refusing to defend DOMA in the courts— makes a mockery of the President’s inaugural oath.","203",NA

"That assurance has never been more needed than it is today, as liberal elites try to drive religious beliefs— and religious believers—out of the public square.","603",NA
"The most offensive instance of this war on religion has been the current Administration’s attempt to compel faithrelated institutions, as well as believing individuals, to contravene their deeply held religious, moral, or ethical beliefs regarding health services, traditional marriage, or abortion.","603",NA
"This forcible secularization of religious and religiously affiliated organizations, including faithbased hospitals and colleges, has been in tandem with the current Administration’s audacity in declaring which faithrelated activities are, or are not, protected by the First Amendment—an unprecedented aggression repudiated by a unanimous Supreme Court in its HosannaTabor v.

"As the center of our government, the District contains many potential targets for terrorist attacks.","104",NA
"Federal security agencies should work closely with local officials and regional administrations like the Washington Area Metropolitan Transit Authority.","605",NA
"A top priority must be ensuring that all public transportation, especially Metro rails, is functioning in the event of an emergency evacuation.","605",NA
"Also, to ensure protection of the fundamental right to keep and bear arms, we call on the governing authority to pass laws consistent with the Supreme Court’s decisions in the District of Columbia v. Heller and McDonald v. Chicago cases, which upheld the fundamental right to keep and bear arms for selfdefense.","203",NA
"We oppose statehood for the District of Columbia.","000",NA
"Modernizing the Federal Civil Service",NA,NA
"The federal workforce bears great responsibilities and sometimes wields tremendous power, especially when Congress delegates to it the execution of complicated and farreaching legislation.","303",NA
"We recognize the dedication of federal workers and the difficulty of their thankless task of implementing poorly drafted or openended legislation.","701",NA
"Under the current Administration, the civil service has grown by at least 140,000 workers, while the number making at least $150,000 has doubled.","303",NA
"At a time when the national debt has increased to over $15.9 trillion under the current Administration, this is grossly irresponsible.","303",NA
"The American people work too hard and too long to support a bloated government.","303",NA
"We call for a reduction, through attrition, in the federal payroll of at least 10 percent and the adjustment of pay scales and benefits to reflect those of the private sector.","303",NA
"We must bring the 130year old Civil Service System into the twentyfirst century.","303",NA
"The federal pay system should be sufficiently flexible to acknowledge and reward those who dare to innovate, reduce overhead, optimize processes, and expedite paperwork.","303",NA
"Delinquency in paying taxes and repaying student loans has been too common in some segments of the civil service.","303",NA
"A Republican Administration will make enforcement among its own employees a priority","605",NA
"and, unlike the current Administration, will name to public office no one who has failed to meet their financial obligations to the government and fellow taxpayers.","305",NA
"America’s Future in Space: Continuing this Quest",NA,NA
"The exploration of space has been a key part of U.S. global leadership","107",NA
"and has supported innovation and ownership of technology.","411",NA
"Over the last halfcentury, in partnership with our aerospace industry, the work of NASA has helped define and strengthen our nation’s technological prowess.","411",NA
"From building the world’s most powerful rockets to landing men on the Moon, sending robotic spacecraft throughout our solar system and beyond, building the International Space Station, and launching spacebased telescopes that allow scientists to better understand our universe, NASA science and engineering have produced spectacular results.","411",NA
"The technologies that emerged from those programs propelled our aerospace industrial base and directly benefit our national security, safety, economy, and quality of life.","411",NA
"Through its achievements, NASA has inspired generations of Americans to study science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, leading to careers that drive our country’s technological and economic engines.","411",NA
"Today, America’s leadership in space is challenged by countries eager to emulate—and surpass— NASA’s accomplishments.","601",NA

"We welcome their greater participation in all aspects of the political process","202",NA
"and affirm their right to seek the full extension of the Constitution, with all the rights and responsibilities it entails.","202",NA
"U.S. territories face serious economic challenges as they struggle to retain existing industries and develop new ones.","408",NA
"Development of local energy options is crucial to reduce their dependence on imported fuel","416",NA
"and promote economic stability.","414",NA
"The Pacific territories should have flexibility to determine the minimum wage, which has seriously restricted progress in the private sector.","301",NA
"A stronger private sector can raise wages,","401",NA
"reduce dependence on public sector employment,","401",NA
"and lead toward local selfsufficiency.","301",NA
"All unreasonable economic impediments must be removed, including unreasonable U.S. customs practices.","407",NA
"We support the right of the United States citizens of Puerto Rico to be admitted to the Union as a fully sovereign state if they freely so determine.","000",NA
"We recognize that Congress has the final authority to define the constitutionally valid options for Puerto Rico to achieve a permanent nonterritorial status with government by consent and full enfranchisement.","302",NA
"As long as Puerto Rico is not a State, however, the will of its people regarding their political status should be ascertained by means of a general right of referendum or specific referenda sponsored by the U.S. government.","202",NA
"Renewing American Values to Build Healthy Families, Great Schools and Safe Neighborhoods",NA,NA
"We are the party of independent individuals and the institutions they create—families, schools, congregations, neighborhoods—to advance their ideals and make real their dreams.","606",NA
"Foremost among those institutions is the American family.","603",NA
"It is the foundation of our society and the first level of selfgovernment.","603",NA
"Its daily lessons–cooperation, patience, mutual respect, responsibility, selfreliance – are fundamental to the order and progress of our Republic.","603",NA
"Government can never replace the family.","603",NA
"That is why we insist that public policy, from taxation to education, from healthcare to welfare, be formulated with attention to the needs and strengths of the family.","603",NA
"Preserving and Protecting Traditional Marriage",NA,NA
"The institution of marriage is the foundation of civil society.","603",NA
"Its success as an institution will determine our success as a nation.","603",NA
"It has been proven by both experience and endless social science studies that traditional marriage is best for children.","603",NA
"Children raised in intact married families are more likely to attend college, are physically and emotionally healthier, are less likely to use drugs or alcohol, engage in crime, or get pregnant outside of marriage.","603",NA
"The success of marriage directly impacts the economic wellbeing of individuals.","603",NA
"Furthermore, the future of marriage affects freedom.","603",NA
"The lack of family formation not only leads to more government costs,","303",NA
"but also to more government control over the lives of its citizens in all aspects.","201",NA
"We recognize and honor the courageous efforts of those who bear the many burdens of parenting alone, even as we believe that marriage, the union of one man and one woman must be upheld as the national standard, a goal to stand for, encourage, and promote through laws governing marriage.","603",NA
"We embrace the principle that all Americans should be treated with respect and dignity.","503",NA
"Creating a Culture of Hope: Raising Families Beyond Poverty",NA,NA
"The Republicanled welfare reforms enacted in 1996 marked a revolution in government’s approach to poverty.","505",NA
"They changed the standard for policy success from the amount of income transferred to the poor to the number of poor who moved from welfare to economic independence.","505",NA
"We took the belief of most Americans—that welfare should be a hand up, not a hand out—and made it law.","505",NA
"Work requirements, though modest, were at the heart of this success.","505",NA
"That is why so many are now outraged by the current Administration’s recent decision to permit waivers for work requirements for welfare benefits,","505",NA
"in other words, to administratively repeal the most successful antipoverty policy in memory.","503",NA
"Instead of undermining the expectation that lowincome parents and individuals should strive to support themselves, benefit programs like food stamps must ensure that those benefits are better targeted to those who need help the most.","505",NA
"For the sake of lowincome families as well as the taxpayers, the federal government’s entire system of public assistance should be reformed to ensure that it promotes work.","505",NA
"Each year, this system dispenses nearly $1 trillion in taxpayer funds across a maze of approximately 80 programs that are neither coordinated nor effective in solving poverty and lifting up families.","503",NA
"For many individuals collecting benefits from multiple categorical programs, efforts to work or earn more actually result in less money in their pocket through the resulting loss of benefits.","505",NA
"This poverty trap would ensnare even more Americans if Obamacare were implemented.","503",NA
"Taking a part time job, working an extra shift, or even just marrying someone who works, would result in a loss of benefits, thereby discouraging the very acts necessary to achieve the American Dream.","601",NA
"Adoption and Foster Care",NA,NA
"Families formed or enlarged by adoption strengthen our communities and ennoble our nation.","603",NA
"We applaud the Republican legislative initiatives that led to a significant increase in adoptions in recent years,","603",NA
"and we call upon the private sector to consider the needs of adoptive families on a par with others.","503",NA
"Any restructuring of the federal tax code should recognize the financial impact of the adoption process and the commitment made by adoptive families.","603",NA
"The nation’s foster care system remains a necessary fallback for youngsters from troubled families.","706",NA
"Because of reforms initiated by many States, the number of foster children has declined to just over 400,000.","706",NA
"A major problem of the system is its lack of support, financial and otherwise, for teens who age out of foster care and into a world in which many are not prepared to go it alone.","706",NA
"We urge States to work with the faithbased and other community groups which reach out to these young people in need.","603",NA
"Making the Internet FamilyFriendly",NA,NA
"Millions of Americans suffer from problem or pathological gambling that can destroy families.","603",NA
"We support the prohibition of gambling over the Internet and call for reversal of the Justice Department’s decision distorting the formerly accepted meaning of the Wire Act that could open the door to Internet betting.","603",NA
"The Internet must be made safe for children.","605",NA
"We call on service providers to exercise due care to ensure that the Internet cannot become a safe haven for predators","605",NA
"while respecting First Amendment rights.","203",NA
"We congratulate the social networking sites that bar known sex offenders from participation.","000",NA
"We urge active prosecution against child pornography, which is closely linked to the horrors of human trafficking.","605",NA
"Current laws on all forms of pornography and obscenity need to be vigorously enforced.","605",NA
"Advancing Americans with Disabilities",NA,NA
"We renew our commitment to the inclusion of Americans with disabilities in all aspects of our national life.","503",NA
"In keeping with that commitment, we oppose the nonconsensual withholding of care or treatment from people with disabilities,  including newborns, as well as the elderly and infirm,","503",NA
"just as we oppose euthanasia and assisted suicide,","603",NA
"which endanger especially those on the margins of society.","503",NA
"Because government should set a positive standard in hiring and contracting for the services of persons with disabilities, we need to update the statutory authority for the Ability One program, a major avenue by which those productive members of our society can offer high quality services.","503",NA
"The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) has opened up unprecedented opportunities for many students,","506",NA
"and we reaffirm our support for its goal of minimizing the separation of children with disabilities from their peers.","503",NA
"We urge preventive efforts in early childhood,","504",NA
"especially assistance in gaining prereading skills, to help many students move beyond the need for IDEA’s protections.","506",NA
"We endorse the program of Employment First, developed by major disability rights groups, to replace dependency with jobs in the mainstream of the American workforce.","701",NA
"Repealing Obamacare",NA,NA
"The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act—Obamacare—was never really about healthcare, though its impact upon the nation’s health is disastrous.","305",NA
"From its start, it was about power, the expansion of government control over one sixth of our economy,","401",NA
"and resulted in an attack on our Constitution, by requiring that U.S. citizens purchase health insurance.","203",NA
"We agree with the four dissenting justices of the Supreme Court: “In our view the entire Act before us is invalid in its entirety.”","000",NA
"It was the highwater mark of an outdated liberalism","305",NA
", the latest attempt to impose upon Americans a eurostyle bureaucracy to manage all aspects of their lives.","000",NA
"Obamacare has been struck down in the court of public opinion and is falling by the weight of its own confusing, unworkable, budgetbusting, and conflicting provisions.","505",NA
"It would tremendously expand Medicaid without significant reform,","505",NA
"leaving the States to assume unsustainable financial burdens.","301",NA
"If fully implemented, it could not function;","303",NA
"and Republican victories in the November elections will guarantee that it is never implemented.","505",NA
"Congressional Republicans are committed to its repeal;","305",NA
"and a Republican President, on the first day in office, will use his legitimate waiver authority under that law to halt its progress and then will sign its repeal.","505",NA
"Then the American people, through the free market, can advance affordable and responsible healthcare reform that meets the needs and concerns of patients and providers.","401",NA
"Through Obamacare, the current Administration has promoted the notion of abortion as healthcare.","603",NA
"We, however, affirm the dignity of women by protecting the sanctity of human life.","603",NA
"Numerous studies have shown that abortion endangers the health and wellbeing of women, and we stand firmly against it.","603",NA
"Our Prescription for American Healthcare: Improve Quality and Lower Costs",NA,NA
"We believe that taking care of one’s health is an individual responsibility.","505",NA
"Chronic diseases, many of them related to lifestyle, drive healthcare costs, accounting for more than 75 percent of the nation’s medical spending.","504",NA
"To reduce demand, and thereby lower costs, we must foster personal responsibility while increasing preventive services to promote healthy lifestyles.","505",NA
"We believe that all Americans should have improved access to affordable, coordinated, quality healthcare,","504",NA
"including individuals struggling with mental illness.","503",NA
"Our goal is to encourage the development of a healthcare system that provides higher quality care at a lower cost to all Americans","504",NA

" For most  Americans,  those  who  are  insured  now  or  who seek  insurance  in  the  future,  our  practical,  nonintrusive  reforms  will  promote  flexibility  in  State  leadership  in  healthcare  reform,","301",NA

" All  of which  will  return  direction  of  the  nation’s  healthcare to  the  people  and  away  from  the  federal  government.","505",NA
"To return the States to their proper role of regulating  local  insurance  markets  and  caring  for  the needy,  we  propose  to  block  grant  Medicaid  and  other payments  to  the  States;","505",NA
" limit  federal  requirements  on both  private  insurance  and  Medicaid;","505",NA
" assist  all  patients,  including  those  with  preexisting  conditions, through  reinsurance  and  risk  adjustment;","504",NA

" We  call  on  State  officials  to  carefully  consider the  increased  costs  of  medical  mandates,  imposed under  their  laws,  which  may  price  many  lowincome families  out  of  the  insurance  market.  ","301",NA
" We  call  on  the government  to  permanently  ban  all  federal  funding and  subsidies  for  abortion  and  healthcare  plans  that include  abortion  coverage.","603",NA
"To  achieve  a  free  market  in  healthcare  and  ensure competition,  we  will  promote  price  transparency  so that  consumers  will  know  the  actual  cost  of  treatments  before  they  undergo  them.  ","401",NA
"When  patients  are aware  of  costs,  they  are  less  likely  to  overutilize  services.","505",NA
"We support legislation to cap noneconomic damages in medical malpractice lawsuits,","403",NA
"thereby relieving conscientious providers of burdens that are not rightly theirs and addressing a serious cause of escalating medical bills.","403",NA
"We will empower individuals and small businesses to form purchasing pools in order to expand coverage to the uninsured.","402",NA
"Individuals with preexisting conditions who maintain continuous insurance coverage should be protected from discrimination.","503",NA
"  We  support  technology  enhancements  for  medical  health  records  and  data  systems","411",NA
"while  affirming  patient  privacy  and  ownership  of health  information.  ","201",NA
"Ensuring Consumer Choice in Healthcare",NA,NA
"Consumer choice is the most powerful factor in healthcare reform.","401",NA
"Today’s highly mobile work force requires portability of insurance coverage that can go with them from job to job.","504",NA
"The need to maintain coverage should not dictate where families have to live and work.","603",NA
"Putting the patient at the center of policy decisions will increase choice and reduce costs while ensuring that services provide what Americans actually want.","505",NA
"We must end tax discrimination against the individual purchase of insurance and allow consumers to purchase insurance across State lines.","401",NA
"While promoting “coinsurance” products and alternatives to “fee for service,” government must promote Health Savings Accounts and Health Reimbursement Accounts to be used for insurance premiums","505",NA
"and should encourage the private sector to rate competing insurance plans.","401",NA
"We will ensure that America’s aging population has access to safe and affordable care.","504",NA
"Because seniors overwhelmingly desire to age at home, we will make home care a priority in public policy.","504",NA
"We will champion the right of individual choice in senior care.","505",NA
"We will aggressively implement programs to protect against elder abuse,","503",NA
"and we will work to ensure that quality care is provided across the care continuum from home to nursing home to hospice.","504",NA
"Supporting Federal Healthcare Research and Development",NA,NA
"We support federal investment in healthcare delivery systems and solutions creating innovative means to provide greater, more costeffective access to high quality healthcare.","504",NA
"We also support federal investment in basic and applied biomedical research, especially the neuroscience research that may hold great potential for dealing with diseases and disorders such as Autism, Alzheimer’s, and Parkinson’s.","411",NA
"If we are to make significant headway against breast and prostate cancer, diabetes, and other killers, research must consider the special needs of formerly neglected groups.","706",NA
"We call for expanded support for the stemcell research that now offers the greatest hope for many afflictions–","504",NA
"with adult stem cells, umbilical cord blood, and cells reprogrammed into pluripotent stem cells–without the destruction of embryonic human life.","603",NA
"We urge a ban on human cloning and on the creation of or experimentation on human embryos.","603",NA
"We support restoring the Drug Enforcement Administration ban on the use of controlled substances for physicianassisted suicide.","603",NA
"We oppose the FDA approval of Mifeprex, formerly known as RU486, and similar drugs that terminate innocent human life after conception.","603",NA
"Protecting Individual Conscience in Healthcare",NA,NA
"No healthcare professional or organization should ever be required to perform, provide for, withhold, or refer for a medical service against their conscience.","603",NA
"This is especially true of the religious organizations which deliver a major portion of America’s healthcare, a service rooted in the charity of faith communities.","603",NA
"We do not believe, however, that healthcare providers should be allowed to withhold services because the healthcare provider believes the patient’s life is not worth living.","503",NA
"We support the ability of all organizations to provide, purchase, or enroll in healthcare coverage consistent with their religious, moral or ethical convictions without discrimination or penalty.","603",NA
"We likewise support the right of parents to consent to medical treatment for their children, including mental health treatment, drug treatment, and treatment involving pregnancy, contraceptives and abortion.","603",NA
"We urge enactment of pending legislation that would require parental consent to transport girls across state lines for abortions.","603",NA
"Reforming the FDA",NA,NA
"America’s leadership in life sciences R&D and medical innovation is being threatened.","411",NA
"As a country, we must work together now or lose our leadership position in medical innovation, U.S. job creation, and access to lifesaving treatments for U.S. patients.","606",NA
"The United States has led the global medical device and pharmaceutical industries for decades.","601",NA
"This leadership has made the U.S. the medical innovation capital of the world,","601",NA
"bringing millions of highpaying jobs to our country","701",NA
"and lifesaving devices and drugs to our nation’s patients.","504",NA
"But that leadership position is at risk;","601",NA
"patients, innovators, and job creators point to the lack of predictability, consistency, transparency and efficiency at the Food and Drug Administration that is driving innovation overseas, benefiting foreign, not U.S., patients.","303",NA
"We pledge to reform the FDA so we can ensure that the U.S. remains the world leader in medical innovation,","303",NA
"that device and drug jobs stay in the U.S.","701",NA
"that U.S. patients benefit first from new devices and drugs,","504",NA
"and that the FDA no longer wastes U.S. taxpayer and innovators’ resources because of bureaucratic red tape and legal uncertainty.","303",NA
"Reducing Costs through Tort Reform",NA,NA
"Frivolous medical malpractice lawsuits have ballooned the cost of healthcare for the average American.","504",NA
"Physicians are increasingly practicing defensive medicine because of the looming threat of malpractice liability.","403",NA
"Moreover, some medical practitioners are avoiding patients with complex and highrisk medical problems because of the high costs of medical malpractice lawsuits.","504",NA
"Rural America is hurt especially hard as obstetricians, surgeons, and other healthcare providers are moving to urban settings or retiring,","703",NA
"causing a significant healthcare workforce shortage","701",NA
"and subsequently decreasing access to care for all patients.","504",NA
"We are committed to aggressively pursuing tort reform legislation to help avoid the practice of defensive medicine,","403",NA
"to keep healthcare costs low,","504",NA
"and improve healthcare quality.","504",NA
"Education: A Chance for Every Child",NA,NA
"Parents are responsible for the education of their children.","603",NA
"We do not believe in a one size fits all approach to education","506",NA
"and support providing broad education choices to parents and children at the State and local level.","301",NA
"Maintaining American preeminence requires a worldclass system of education, with high standards, in which all students can reach their potential.","506",NA
"Today’s education reform movement calls for accountability at every stage of schooling.","506",NA
"It affirms higher expectations for all students and rejects the crippling bigotry of low expectations.","506",NA
"It recognizes the wisdom of State and local control of our schools","301",NA
", and it wisely sees consumer rights in education—choice— as the most important driving force for renewing our schools.","507",NA
"Education is much more than schooling.","506",NA
"It is the whole range of activities by which families and communities transmit to a younger generation","606",NA
", not just knowledge and skills, but ethical and behavioral norms and traditions.","603",NA
"It is the handing over of a personal and cultural identity.","601",NA
"That is why education choice has expanded so vigorously.","506",NA
"It is also why American education has, for the last several decades, been the focus of constant controversy,","000",NA
"as centralizing forces outside the family and community have sought to remake education in order to remake America.","507",NA
"They have not succeeded, but they have done immense damage.","506",NA
"Attaining Academic Excellence for All",NA,NA
"Since 1965 the federal government has spent $2 trillion on elementary and secondary education with no substantial improvement in academic achievement or high school graduation rates (which currently are 59 percent for AfricanAmerican students and 63 percent for Hispanics).","507",NA
"The U.S. spends an average of more than $10,000 per pupil per year in public schools, for a total of more than $550 billion.","507",NA
"That represents more than 4 percent of GDP devoted to K12 education in 2010.","507",NA
"Of that amount, federal spending was more than $47 billion.","408",NA
"Clearly, if money were the solution, our schools would be problemfree.","507",NA
"More money alone does not necessarily equal better performance.","506",NA
"After years of trial and error, we know what does work, what has actually made a difference in student advancement, and what is powering education reform at the local level all across America: accountability on the part of administrators, parents and teachers;","506",NA
"higher academic standards;","506",NA
"programs that support the development of character and financial literacy;","506",NA
"periodic rigorous assessments on the fundamentals, especially math, science, reading, history, and geography;","506",NA
"renewed focus on the Constitution and the writings of the Founding Fathers,","601",NA
"and an accurate account of American history that celebrates the birth of this great nation;","601",NA
"transparency, so parents and the public can discover which schools best serve their pupils;","506",NA
"flexibility and freedom to innovate, so schools can adapt to the special needs of their students and hold teachers and administrators responsible for student performance.","507",NA
"We support the innovations in education reform occurring at the State level based upon proven results.","301",NA
"Republican Governors have led in the effort to reform our country’s underperforming education system, and we applaud these advancements.","305",NA
"We advocate the policies and methods that have proven effective: building on the basics, especially STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering, and math) and phonics;","506",NA
"ending social promotions;","503",NA
"merit pay for good teachers;","506",NA
"classroom discipline;","603",NA
"parental involvement;","603",NA
"and strong leadership by principals, superintendents, and locally elected school boards.","506",NA
"Because technology has become an essential tool of learning, proper implementation of technology is a key factor in providing every child equal access and opportunity.","506",NA
"Consumer Choice in Education",NA,NA
"The Republican Party is the party of fresh and innovative ideas in education.","305",NA
"We support options for learning, including home schooling and local innovations like singlesex classes, fullday school hours, and yearround schools.","506",NA
"School choice—whether through charter schools, open enrollment requests, college lab schools, virtual schools, career and technical education programs, vouchers, or tax credits—is important for all children,","401",NA
"especially for families with children trapped in failing schools.","507",NA
"Getting those youngsters into decent learning environments","706",NA
"and helping them to realize their full potential is the greatest civil rights challenge of our time.","201",NA
"We support the promotion of local career and technical educational programs and entrepreneurial programs that have been supported by leaders in industry and will retrain and retool the American workforce, which is the best in the world.","411",NA
"A young person’s ability to achieve in school must be based on his or her Godgiven talent and motivation, not an address, zip code, or economic status.","503",NA
"In sum, on the one hand enormous amounts of money are being spent for K12 public education with overall results that do not justify that spending.","507",NA
"On the other hand, the common experience of families, teachers, and administrators forms the basis of what does work in education.","507",NA
"We believe the gap between those two realities can be successfully bridged,","000",NA
"and Congressional Republicans are pointing a new way forward with major reform legislation.","507",NA
"We support its concept of block grants and the repeal of numerous federal regulations which interfere with State and local control of public schools.","301",NA
"The bulk of the federal money through Title I for lowincome children and through IDEA for disabled youngsters should follow the students to whatever school they choose so that eligible pupils, through open enrollment, can bring their share of the funding with them.","506",NA
"The Republicanfounded D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program should be expanded as a model for the rest of the country.","506",NA
"We deplore the efforts by Congressional Democrats and the current President to kill this successful program for disadvantaged students in order to placate the leaders of the teachers’ unions.","702",NA
"We support putting the needs of students before the special interests of unions when approaching elementary and secondary education reform.","702",NA
"Because parents are a child’s first teachers, we support family literacy programs, which improve the reading, language, and life skills of both parents and children from lowincome families.","506",NA
"To ensure that all students have access to the mainstream of American life, we support the English First approach","608",NA
"and oppose divisive programs that limit students’ ability to advance in American society.","503",NA

"In tandem with this, the current Administration has systematically undermined America’s missile defense, abandoning the missile defense bases in Poland and the Czech Republic, reducing the number of planned interceptors in Alaska, and cutting the budget for missile defense.","104",NA
"In an embarrassing open microphone discussion with former Russian President Medvedev, the current President made clear that, if he wins a second term, he intends to exercise “more flexibility” to appease Russia, which means further undermining our missile defense capabilities.","104",NA
