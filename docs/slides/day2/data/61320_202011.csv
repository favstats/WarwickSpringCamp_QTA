"DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CONVENTION LAND ACKNOWLEDGEMENT","H",NA
"The Democratic National Committee wishes to acknowledge that we gather together to state our values on lands that have been stewarded through many centuries by the ancestors and descendants of Tribal Nations who have been here since time immemorial.","607.3",NA
"We honor the communities native to this continent, and recognize that our country was built on Indigenous homelands.","607.3",NA
"We pay our respects to the millions of Indigenous people throughout history who have protected our lands, waters, and animals.","607.3",NA
"We respectfully acknowledge that we present this Platform at our 2020 Democratic National Convention on the lands of the Bad River Band of the Lake Superior Tribe of Chippewa Indians, the Forest County Potawatomi Community, the Ho-Chunk Nation, the Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa, the Lac du Flambeau Band of Lake Superior Chippewa, the Menominee Nation, the Oneida Nation of Wisconsin, the Red Cliff Band of Lake Superior Chippewa, the St. Croix Chippewa Indians of Wisconsin, the Sokaogon Chippewa Community, and the Stockbridge-Munsee Community, Band of Mohican Indians.","607.3",NA
"PREAMBLE","H",NA
"America is an idea—one that has endured and evolved through war and depression, prevailed over fascism and communism, and radiated hope to far distant corners of the earth.","601.1",NA
"Americans believe that diversity is our greatest strength.","607.1",NA
"That protest is among the highest forms of patriotism.","601.1",NA
"That our fates and fortunes are bound to rise and fall together.","601.1",NA
"That even when we fall short of our highest ideals, we never stop trying to build a more perfect union.","601.1",NA
"When the American people go to the polls this fall, we will be choosing more than a candidate.","202.1",NA
"Character is on the ballot in this election.","202.1",NA
"The character of our President, yes, but more than that: the character of our democracy, our society, and our leadership in the world.","601.1",NA
"The challenges before us—the worst public health crisis in a century, the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression, the worst period of global upheaval in a generation, the urgent global crisis posed by climate change, the intolerable racial injustice that still stains the fabric of our nation—will test America’s character like never before.","606.1",NA
"The COVID-19 pandemic has laid bare deep-seated problems in our society— the fragility of our economy","403",NA
"and social safety net,","504",NA
"the risks posed by growing inequality,","503",NA
"the impacts of racial and economic disparities on health and well-being,","503",NA
"and the profound consequences of deepening polarization and political paralysis.","602.1",NA
"The bill has come due on the Trump Administration’s hollowing out of our public institutions:","305.2",NA
"the sidelining of experts,","411",NA
"the rejection of science,","411",NA
"the underinvestment in research,","411",NA
"and the gross corruption and abuses of power.","304",NA
"President Trump’s dereliction of duty has caused the deaths of tens of thousands of Americans, the loss of tens of millions of American jobs, and lasting harm to our children’s education and future.","305.2",NA
"And it has revealed, at tragic economic and human cost, the emptiness of the Republican Party’s “America First” foreign policy.","305.1",NA
"Under President Trump, America stands alone.","305.2",NA
"Friends and foes alike neither admire nor fear President Trump’s leadership—they dismiss and ridicule it.","305.2",NA
"The Republican Party under President Trump has made America small—","305.1",NA
"when we are a people called to do the greatest things.","601.1",NA
"Democrats will fight to repair the soul of this nation.","305.1",NA
"To unite and to heal our country.","601.1",NA
"To turn this crisis into a crucible, from which we will forge a stronger, brighter, and more equitable future.","601.1",NA
"We must right the wrongs in our democracy,","202.1",NA
"redress the systemic injustices that have long plagued our society,","202.1",NA
"throw open the doors of opportunity for all Americans,","503",NA
"and reinvent our institutions at home","202.1",NA
"and our leadership abroad.","601.1",NA
"We do not simply aspire to return our country to where we were four years ago.","601.1",NA
"We know we must be bolder and more ambitious.","601.1",NA
"We must once again stop another Republican recession from becoming a second Great Depression.","414",NA
"President Trump and the Republican Party have rigged the economy in favor of the wealthiest few and the biggest corporations, and left working families and small businesses out in the cold.","403",NA
"Democrats will forge a new social and economic contract with the American people—a contract that creates millions of new jobs","701",NA
"and promotes shared prosperity,","503",NA
"closes racial gaps in income and wealth,","503",NA
"guarantees the right to join or form a union,","701",NA
"raises wages","701",NA
"and ensures equal pay for women","503",NA
"and paid family leave for all,","503",NA
"and safeguards a secure and dignified retirement.","504",NA
"We must guarantee health care not as a privilege for some, but as a right for every single American.","504",NA
"For a century, Democrats have fought to secure universal health care.","504",NA
"In the depths of the COVID-19 pandemic, President Trump and the Republican Party are trying to tear health care away from millions of people who depend on it for survival.","504",NA
"Democrats will not allow that to happen.","305.1",NA
"We will not rest until every American can access quality health care and affordable prescription drugs.","504",NA
"We must steel and strengthen our democracy, not distort and debase it.","202.1",NA
"Democrats believe there is nothing to fear from the voices and votes of the American people.","202.1",NA
"We will restore the full power of the Voting Rights Act and stamp out voter suppression in all its forms.","202.1",NA
"We will curb the corrupting influence of money in politics","304",NA
"and protect the integrity of our elections from all enemies, foreign and domestic.","202.1",NA
"We will never accept political gridlock as our fate.","305.1",NA
"We will never tire in our fight to deliver results and create opportunity for all Americans.","503",NA
"And we will end the war on government that has politicized our institutions, denigrated public service, and left the American people on their own instead of working to make them whole.","601.1",NA
"We must heal our nation’s deepest wounds, not fan the flames of hate.","601.1",NA
"Democrats will root out structural and systemic racism in our economy and our society,","503",NA
"and reform our criminal justice system from top to bottom, because we believe Black lives matter.","503",NA
"We will ensure that our nation continues to prize diversity and compassion,","607.1",NA
"and welcomes those who yearn to participate in our great democratic experiment by creating a humane, 21st century immigration system that benefits all Americans.","602.2",NA
"We will give hate no safe harbor.","503",NA
"We will never amplify or legitimize the voices of racism, misogyny, anti-Semitism, anti-Muslim bigotry, or white supremacy.","503",NA
"Democrats will protect and promote the equal rights of all our citizens—women, LGBTQ+ people, religious minorities, people with disabilities, Native Americans, and all who have been discriminated against in too many ways and for too many generations.","503",NA
"We commit ourselves to the vision articulated by Frederick Douglass of “a Government founded upon justice, and recognizing the equal rights of all.”","503",NA
"We must lead the world in taking on the climate crisis, not deny the science and accelerate the damage.","501",NA
"From Houston, Texas, to Mexico Beach, Florida; from San Juan, Puerto Rico, to Davenport, Iowa, the last four years have seen record-breaking storms, devastating wildfires, and historic floods.","501",NA
"Democrats will rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement","501",NA
"and go further, building a thriving, equitable, and globally competitive clean energy economy","416.2",NA
"that puts workers and communities first,","701",NA
"and leaves no one behind.","503",NA
"We must provide a world-class education in every ZIP code, to every child, because education is a critical public good.","506",NA
"Democrats believe in universal early childhood education,","506",NA
"and affordable, high-quality child care.","504",NA
"We will shut down the school-to-prison pipeline, and build a school-to-opportunity pipeline in its place.","506",NA
"We will make college affordable again,","506",NA
"and give Americans relief from crushing student debt.","409",NA
"We commit to a foreign policy that accelerates our domestic renewal, not undermines it.","601.1",NA
"We will focus on what matters most to Americans—more and better jobs,","701",NA
"greater security","605.1",NA
", a cleaner environment,","501",NA
"and a more inclusive and resilient society.","503",NA
"Democrats will lead with diplomacy as our tool of first resort","105",NA
"and mobilize our allies and partners to meet the tests none of us can meet on our own.","107",NA
"We will stand up to the forces of authoritarianism, not aid and abet their rise,","202.1",NA
"and we will speak and act with clarity and purpose on behalf of human rights wherever they are under threat.","201.2",NA
"And we will honor our sacred covenant with our women and men in uniform, our veterans, and our military families","104",NA
"who have carried the burdens of wars that must—at long last—come to an end.","105",NA
"Above all, Democrats still believe in the American idea—its principles, its purpose, and its promise.","601.1",NA
"We know that four more years of the crass, craven, corrupt leadership we have seen from Donald Trump and the Republican Party will damage our character and our country beyond repair.","601.1",NA
"We pray, as Langston Hughes did, “O, let America be America again—the land that never has been yet—and yet must be—the land where every man is free.”","201.1",NA
"Democrats call on all Americans to come together and seize this last, best chance to restore the soul of our nation","601.1",NA
"—and vote this November to ensure our greatest days are still to come.","601.1",NA
"PROTECTING AMERICANS AND RECOVERING FROM THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC","H",NA
"When we do not have competent, experienced, compassionate leaders in government, the American people suffer.","305.2",NA
"That is the case with the novel coronavirus.","305.2",NA
"President Trump and his Administration missed multiple opportunities to protect the American people from this deadly pathogen.","305.2",NA
"Instead of recognizing the danger and confronting it head-on, President Trump lied to the American people about the disease’s severity, its transmissibility, and the threat it posed to lives and livelihoods.","305.2",NA
"Make no mistake: President Trump’s abject failure to respond forcefully and capably to the COVID-19 pandemic—his failure to lead—makes him responsible for the deaths of tens of thousands of Americans.","305.2",NA
"COVID-19 has laid bare deep fault lines in our economy, our society, and our health care system.","602.1",NA
"Disparities in health care access, in access to paid sick leave, in environmental quality, in the employment market, and in housing have contributed to disproportionate rates of infection and death among Black Americans, Native Americans, Latinos, and certain Asian American and Pacific Islander communities.","503",NA
"President Trump’s failure to pay attention to early intelligence reports about the pandemic wasted critical weeks in which we could have prepared for the outbreak.","305.2",NA
"Once the pandemic began spreading in the United States, the President’s failure to lay out clear, consistent guidelines for cities, states, businesses, and school districts to control the spread of COVID-19 created widespread confusion and chaos.","305.2",NA
"His reckless disregard for the advice of public health experts has made it harder for mayors and governors to protect the American people.","305.2",NA
"Rather than surge the production of personal protective equipment and other critical supplies where they were needed most, the Administration held life-saving resources hostage for political obeisance.","305.2",NA
"Instead of bringing Americans together, President Trump tried to divide us, using racist and xenophobic rhetoric that has contributed to an increase in hate crimes against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.","503",NA
"And in the midst of the pandemic, the Trump Administration is arguing in court to invalidate the Affordable Care Act and rip health coverage away from tens of millions of people.","504",NA
"President Trump and his Administration have also failed to drive an economic response that is commensurate with the scale of the challenge before us,","409",NA
"preferring to act as though the recession caused by his incompetent mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic will correct itself.","409",NA
"He has hung small businesses out to dry while cutting blank checks to the largest corporations;","403",NA
"failed to enact adequate support for public school systems, colleges, universities,","506",NA
"and state and local governments to maintain public services and jobs;","303",NA
"endangered the health of essential workers by failing to enact workplace safety standards;","701",NA
"and neglected to protect working families from economic ruin.","701",NA
"Democrats will save lives by using every available tool to beat back this pandemic, which continues to sicken and kill hundreds of Americans per day,","305.1",NA
"and lead a global effort to prevent, detect, and respond to future pandemic threats.","107",NA
"We must start by making COVID-19 testing widely available, convenient, and free to everyone.","504",NA
"We must also expand funding so state and local public health departments can hire sufficient staff to conduct contact tracing for everyone who tests positive for the novel coronavirus.","504",NA
"Only through widespread, regular testing and tracing can we hope to understand the scope of the pandemic and contain it.","504",NA
"In a public health crisis, we all have to rely on each other.","504",NA
"That’s why Democrats support making COVID-19 testing, treatment, and any eventual vaccines free to everyone, regardless of their wealth, insurance coverage, or immigration status.","504",NA
"We are all only as safe from this disease as are the most vulnerable among us.","504",NA
"It has always been a crisis that tens of millions of Americans have no or inadequate health insurance—but in a pandemic, it’s catastrophic for public health.","504",NA
"The current crisis would be even worse without the Affordable Care Act in place.","504",NA
"But in the COVID-19 pandemic, Americans need even more help, which is why Democrats will take immediate action to preserve and expand health insurance coverage.","504",NA
"We will provide direct, increased support to states to enroll eligible adults in Medicaid,","504",NA
"have the federal government cover a higher percentage of the bill,","504",NA
"and add incentives for states which have not yet expanded Medicaid to do so.","504",NA
"For people who risk losing their insurance coverage if they lose their jobs in this pandemic and in President Trump’s recession, Democrats believe the federal government should pick up 100 percent of the tab for COBRA insurance, which keeps people on their employer-sponsored plans, without restrictions.","504",NA
"We will re-open the Affordable Care Act marketplaces, even outside of the normal open enrollment season, and expand subsidies to make it easier for people to buy health coverage.","504",NA
"Democrats will also make available on the marketplace a public option administered through the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) which includes a platinum-level choice, with low fees and no deductibles.","504",NA
"Low-income Americans will be automatically enrolled in the public option at zero cost to them, though they may choose to opt out at any time.","504",NA
"We will keep these emergency measures in place until the pandemic ends and unemployment falls significantly.","504",NA
"And should the United States find itself in another pandemic or severe economic downturn in the future, these protections will be made automatically available, so Americans are never again left to fend for themselves in times of crisis.","504",NA
"Democrats are appalled that President Trump failed to act on the advice of Congress to maintain a strong stockpile of critical medical supplies, including personal protective equipment,","504",NA
"or adequately surge U.S. manufacturing of needed equipment through tools like the Defense Production Act.","504",NA
"The resulting equipment shortages endangered millions of lives, including those of our brave frontline health care workers and other essential workers.","504",NA
"Such shortages are unacceptable and must never happen again.","504",NA
"Democrats will direct the federal government to work with private-sector manufacturers to dramatically scale up the United States’ domestic manufacturing capacity for both personal protective equipment and essential medicines.","504",NA
"We will restore federal leadership to ensure medical supplies are distributed according to need, not political favoritism,","504",NA
"and never put states in the position of having to compete against each other for life-saving materials.","504",NA
"Democrats will aggressively enforce non-discrimination protections in the Americans with Disabilities Act and other civil rights laws,","503",NA
"especially when designing emergency management systems and new facilities and services in response to the pandemic.","504",NA
"Democrats will prohibit unjustified segregation of patients with disabilities,","503",NA
"and additionally prohibit rationing of health care that refuses or diverts hospitalization, treatment, or supplies based on a patient’s disability.","503",NA
"We recognize people with disabilities living in group homes and other care facilities are at greater risk of contracting COVID-19,","503",NA
"and that people with disabilities may require additional resources to protect their health, well-being, and independence during the pandemic.","504",NA
"We will improve oversight and expand protections for residents and staff at nursing homes, which have seen some of the worst COVID-19 outbreaks.","504",NA
"And we will expand support for telemedicine, so Americans do not have to go without essential health care during the pandemic.","504",NA
"America must never again be left vulnerable to a global pandemic.","504",NA
"Democrats believe we must follow the informed advice of scientists and public health experts,","305.1",NA
"and will take steps to protect federal scientists from political influence.","304",NA
"Democrats will act swiftly to stand up a comprehensive, national public health surveillance program for COVID-19 and future infectious diseases.","504",NA
"We will recruit at least 100,000 contact tracers with support from trusted local organizations in the communities most at risk to help state and local health departments use culturally competent approaches to identify people at risk of contracting or spreading the coronavirus.","504",NA
"Democrats believe we must reverse decades of underinvestment in America’s public health infrastructure.","504",NA
"We will substantially increase funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)","504",NA
"and for state and local public health departments, many of which suffered deep budget cuts during the Great Recession and are at risk of further cuts as a result of President Trump’s recession.","504",NA
"State and local public health departments should be given sufficient resources to address pandemic diseases and other public health crises through coordinated efforts","504",NA
"that are inclusive of underrepresented groups who may be disproportionately impacted.","503",NA
"Democrats will support medical and public health research grants for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and other Minority-Serving Institutions (MSIs), which are particularly well suited to research health disparities in the context of COVID-19.","506",NA
"Solving the public health crisis posed by the pandemic is the surest way to get the economy back on track.","408",NA
"Countries that have taken aggressive measures to address the COVID-19 pandemic and stop chains of infection from spreading are poised to have stronger, faster recoveries than the United States.","602.1",NA
"But containing the pandemic won’t be enough to repair the damage President Trump has done to our economy and to the American people—or to build back better.","601.1",NA
"During acute economic downturns, Democrats believe that we must take care of our workforce and aim to keep workers whole.","701",NA
"We will reform the current unemployment insurance system to enable more workers to remain attached to their jobs,","504",NA
"including by promoting payroll support and work-sharing programs with generous rates of wage replacement and requirements that employers maintain workers’ benefits.","701",NA
"For those workers who do lose their jobs, we will expand the unemployment insurance system to cover more workers, including independent contractors and gig, part-time, and tipped workers;","504",NA
"make sure platform companies and companies that misclassify employees as contractors pay in to support the system like other employers do","701",NA
"; and raise wage replacement rates, which are far too low in many states.","701",NA
"We will expand, not cut, nutrition assistance and food security programs that millions of Americans are relying on in this crisis.","504",NA
"Democrats will also make long-overdue investments to upgrade and modernize states’ unemployment system technology","303",NA
"and ensure the Department of Labor conducts strong oversight of state unemployment systems to make sure that unemployed workers can quickly and efficiently access the benefits they are owed.","303",NA
"To prevent President Trump’s recession from becoming a depression, Democrats believe we must act immediately to make ambitious investments that will support and create jobs.","701",NA
"We urgently need to support state and local governments, which are suffering severe budget shortfalls due to declines in tax revenues while being asked to shoulder the burden of COVID-related services and rising unemployment.","301",NA
"State and local budget cuts translate quickly into lost jobs in education, health care, and social services—all fields where we need to be adding jobs to meet the needs of the American people.","701",NA
"Democrats will extend significant aid to state and local governments,","301",NA
"school districts","506",NA
", and public and nonprofit colleges and universities, including HBCUs and MSIs,","506",NA
"to address these budget shortfalls","504",NA
"and secure jobs.","701",NA
"We will condition state and federal aid on maintaining and expanding public-sector employment, including provisions to protect workers’ rights.","701",NA
"In states and cities across the country, too many parents are being forced to choose between keeping their jobs and keeping their children safe.","603",NA
"Democrats believe that making child care affordable and widely available is essential to recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic.","504",NA
"We will provide funding to stabilize the sector and ensure child care and educational settings are able to meet the highest possible public health and worker safety standards to protect the health of care workers, children, parents, and the broader community.","504",NA
"The United States is facing an unprecedented housing crisis as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and President Trump's recession, with millions of families at risk of being evicted.","504",NA
"We support state and local measures to freeze rent increases, evictions, utility shutoffs, and late fees for rent, to prevent families from becoming homeless and making the pandemic even worse.","504",NA
"The COVID-19 pandemic has hit small businesses especially hard.","403",NA
"Democrats support making significant, immediate grants and loans to help small businesses make payroll, pay rent and other expenses, and keep their doors open when possible.","402",NA
"Some estimates indicate as many as 40 percent of Black-owned small businesses may not survive President Trump’s recession, and small businesses owned by Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and Latinos are also at risk.","503",NA
"Democrats will prioritize support for Black entrepreneurs and other entrepreneurs of color,","402",NA
"as well as women entrepreneurs","402",NA
", including by expanding funding for Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) and other proven programs that invest in low-income communities and communities of color.","402",NA
"We will impose rigorous oversight on big corporations seeking financial assistance to weather the pandemic and President Trump’s recession,","403",NA
"to ensure that federal dollars support keeping workers on payroll, not enriching CEOs or shareholders.","403",NA
"Taxpayer money should not be used to pay out dividends, fund stock buybacks, or give raises to executives.","403",NA
"No one should have to choose between protecting their health and earning a living.","504",NA
"Paid sick leave is a necessity even under normal circumstances, but in a pandemic, it’s a matter of national security.","504",NA
"This is especially true for the Black, Latino, Asian American and Pacific Islander, Native American, and low-income workers who are less likely to be able to work from home.","503",NA
"We will immediately enact robust paid sick leave protections as part of the COVID-19 response for all workers in the economy, including contractors, gig workers, domestic workers, and the self-employed.","504",NA
"And Democrats will take immediate action to protect essential workers on the job where the Trump Administration has neglected them, from agriculture to meatpacking plants to manufacturing facilities to hospitals,","701",NA
"including by issuing and enforcing effective infectious disease workplace safety standards through the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.","701",NA
"As millions of Americans have stayed at home to prevent the spread of the pandemic, it is plain to see that in the 21st century, an accessible internet is not optional: it is a vital tool for receiving an education and for participating in the economy, and all Americans need access to high-speed, affordable broadband service.","411",NA
"Democrats will take action to prevent states from blocking municipalities and rural co-ops from building publicly-owned broadband networks,","411",NA
"and increase federal support for municipal broadband","411",NA
"while requiring that funding recipients adhere to policies that support good jobs and include strong protections for workers’ right to organize.","701",NA
"We will increase public investment in rural, urban, and Tribal broadband infrastructure,","411",NA

"We will direct federal regulators to review a subset of the mergers and acquisitions that have taken place since President Trump took office, prioritizing the pharmaceutical, health care, telecommunications, technology, and agricultural industries, to assess whether any have increased market concentration, raised consumer prices, demonstrably harmed workers, increased racial inequality, reduced competition, or constricted innovation, and assign appropriate remedies.","403",NA

"Guaranteeing a Secure and Dignified Retirement","H",NA
"Democrats are proud to be the party that advocates retirement security for all.","504",NA

"meaningfully increasing minimum benefit payments,","504",NA
"increasing benefits for long-duration beneficiaries,","504",NA

"We will eliminate provisions that unfairly reduce public sector workers’ earned Social Security benefits.","504",NA
"In light of weakened retirement security for unpaid caregivers and caregivers for family members, who sacrifice not only wages but Social Security benefits when they swap paid labor for unpaid care work, Democrats support Social Security reform which better accounts for the challenges facing unpaid caregivers—","504",NA
"including incremental reforms to the benefit formula to mitigate the penalty for unpaid care.","504",NA
"Democrats will reject every effort to cut, privatize, or weaken Social Security, including attempts to raise the retirement age, diminish benefits by cutting cost-of-living adjustments, or reduce earned benefits.","504",NA

"and take action to protect public and private pensions to ensure workers keep the benefits they have earned, including through multiemployer plans.","701",NA

"Women can no longer be charged more than men just because of their gender.","503",NA
"And more Americans are able to get health coverage than ever before.","504",NA
"Democrats will keep up the fight until all Americans can access secure, affordable, high-quality health insurance","504",NA
"—because as Democrats, we fundamentally believe health care is a right for all, not a privilege for the few.","504",NA
"Unfortunately, at every turn, Democrats’ efforts to guarantee health coverage have been met by obstruction and opposition from the Republican Party.","504",NA
"It has been Republicans who have embraced junk plans that undermine protections for pre-existing conditions.","504",NA
"It was Republican state attorneys general who sued to block Medicaid expansion and Republican governors who refused to extend Medicaid coverage to their citizens, leaving millions of low-income Americans, disproportionately people of color, unable to access health coverage.","504",NA
"And in the midst of the worst global pandemic in generations—one that has left more than 150,000 Americans dead and counting—the Trump Administration is fighting in court to invalidate the entirety of the Affordable Care Act and eliminate insurance for tens of millions of people.","504",NA
"Overturning the Affordable Care Act remains a central plank of the Republican Party platform.","305.1",NA
"The difference in values between the two parties on this life-or-death issue could not be more stark.","305.1",NA
"The COVID-19 pandemic has made this difference in values painfully, brutally clear.","305.1",NA
"President Trump has repeatedly downplayed the threat of the coronavirus, bullied governors for enacting life-saving public health measures, and left our frontline health care heroes without the equipment they need to protect themselves and the American people.","305.2",NA
"The burdens of this pandemic have not been borne equally, as communities of color have suffered higher rates of infection and death,","503",NA
"and struggled to access life-saving care when they need it most.","504",NA
"Our essential workers have been deemed expendable by the President and his Administration.","305.2",NA
"As Democrats, we say with one voice: no more.","305.1",NA
"We are going to at last build the health care system the American people have always deserved: one that finally provides universal health care coverage;","504",NA

"We will build a health care system that is driven by the needs of patients and the people who care for them, instead of the profit motives of corporations.","504",NA
"We will tackle entrenched racial disparities in health care,","503",NA

", and make it easier to access mental health and substance use disorder treatment and long-term services and supports in metropolitan and rural areas alike.","504",NA
"Democrats will always fight to save Americans’ lives by making it easier and more affordable to go to the doctor, get prescription medicines, and access preventive testing and treatments.","504",NA
"Generations of Democrats have been united in the fight for universal health care.","305.1",NA

"Securing Universal Health Care","H",NA
"Through a Public Option","H",NA
"Democrats believe we need to protect, strengthen, and build upon our bedrock health care programs, including the Affordable Care Act, Medicare, Medicaid, and the Veterans Affairs (VA) system.","504",NA
"Private insurers need real competition to ensure they have incentive to provide affordable, quality coverage to every American.","401",NA
"To achieve that objective, we will give all Americans the choice to select a high-quality, affordable public option through the Affordable Care Act marketplace.","504",NA
"The public option will provide at least one plan choice without deductibles;","504",NA
"will be administered by CMS, not private companies;","504",NA
"and will cover all primary care without any co-payments and control costs for other treatments by negotiating prices with doctors and hospitals, just like Medicare does on behalf of older people.","504",NA
"Everyone will be eligible to choose the public option or another Affordable Care Act marketplace plan.","504",NA
"To help close the persistent racial gap in insurance rates, Democrats will expand funding for Affordable Care Act outreach and enrollment programs, so every American knows their options for securing quality, affordable coverage.","504",NA
"The lowest-income Americans, including more than four million adults who should be eligible for Medicaid but who live in states where Republican governors have refused to expand the program, will be automatically enrolled in the public option without premiums;","504",NA
"they may opt out at any time.","504",NA
"And we will enable millions of older workers to choose between their employer-provided plans, the public option, or enrolling in Medicare when they turn 60, instead of having to wait until they are 65.","504",NA
"Democrats are categorically opposed to raising the Medicare retirement age.","504",NA
"Democrats will also empower the states, as laboratories of democracy, to use Affordable Care Act innovation waivers to develop locally tailored approaches to health coverage,","301",NA
"including by removing barriers to states that seek to experiment with statewide universal health care approaches.","301",NA
"We also know that finally covering every American through the public and private insurance system alone is not enough to guarantee universal access.","504",NA
"That is why Democrats support doubling investments in community health centers and rural health clinics in underserved urban and rural areas,","504",NA
"including increased support for dental care, mental health care, and substance use services like medication-assisted treatment,","504",NA
"and why we will increase support for mobile health clinics.","504",NA
"We will enact longer, multi-year funding cycles for these critical health services so they can operate with greater certainty,","504",NA
"as community health centers are the nation’s only providers that are required by law to be both located in medically underserved areas","504",NA
"and required to serve all who seek care, regardless of their ability to pay.","504",NA
"And we will leverage innovative payment options through Medicare and Medicaid to help community health centers and rural health clinics keep their doors open.","504",NA
"We will expand the National Health Service Corps and Teaching Health Center Graduate Medical Education Program to grow a diverse primary care workforce","504",NA
"and to address critical shortages of health care providers in medically underserved rural and urban areas,","504",NA
"including primary care nurses, dental professionals, and mental health and substance use counselors.","504",NA
"Democrats will also increase monitoring and enforcement to ensure that health care facilities are accessible to people with disabilities.","503",NA
"Bringing Down Drug Prices and Taking on the Pharmaceutical Industry","H",NA
"Too many Americans struggle to afford the prescription drugs they need to get or stay healthy.","504",NA
"No American should find themselves foregoing or rationing medications because they can’t afford to pay—","504",NA
"especially when taxpayer money underwrites research leading to the development of many prescription drugs in the first place.","411",NA
"Democrats will take aggressive action to ensure that Americans do not pay more for prescription drugs than people in other advanced economies,","412",NA
"and ensure that all necessary medications are covered.","504",NA
"We will empower Medicare to at last be able to negotiate prescription drug prices for all public and private purchasers—for families and businesses, as well as older Americans—no matter where they get their coverage.","504",NA
"We will also prevent the price of brand-name and outlier generic drugs from rising faster than the inflation rate.","412",NA
"We will cap out-of-pocket drug costs for seniors,","412",NA
"and ensure that effective treatments for chronic health conditions are available at little or no cost.","504",NA
"For too long, prescription drug companies have gamed the system to justify their price increases by any means available.","412",NA
"Democrats will crack down on anti-competitive efforts to manipulate the patent system or collude on prices.","403",NA

"Reducing Health Care Costs and Improving Health Care Quality","H",NA
"The United States spends more per capita on health care than any other advanced economy, and has less to show for it.","602.1",NA
"Health care costs have been increasing for decades, with average premiums for an employer-provided family plan topping $20,000 in 2019.","416.2",NA
"Democrats know we can reduce out-of-pocket costs for families while improving the quality of health care for all.","504",NA
"We will make it easier for working families to afford high-quality insurance in the Affordable Care Act marketplaces by ensuring that no one pays more than 8.5 percent of their income in premiums","412",NA
"and eliminating the cap on subsidies.","412",NA
"Democrats believe that when Americans are in the hospital or an emergency room, they shouldn’t have to worry about whether their health care providers are in-network or not, which is why we will outlaw the predatory practice of surprise medical billing.","403",NA
"We will work to increase price transparency in the health care system across all payers,","403",NA
"and reduce paperwork through uniform medical billing.","403",NA
"And we will vigorously use antitrust laws to fight against mega-mergers in the hospital, insurance, and pharmaceutical industries that would raise prices for patients by undermining market competition.","403",NA
"Excessive prescription drug cost-sharing and voids in coverage such as dental, vision, and hearing services can lead to severe health consequences for Medicare patients.","504",NA
"Democrats will fight any efforts to cut Medicare benefits,","504",NA

"We will also invest in training and hiring more mental health providers, substance use disorder counselors, and peer support counselors,","504",NA

"The opioid epidemic has devastated American communities,","602.1",NA
"and the Trump Administration has completely failed in its response, leaving millions of families desperate for help.","305.1",NA
"Democrats will make medication-assisted treatment available to all who need it,","504",NA

"We believe we must stop over-prescribing while improving access to effective and needed pain management.","504",NA
"Democrats recognize that incarcerated people suffer from serious mental health and substance use disorders at higher rates than the general population, which is why we will support expanded access to mental health and substance use disorder care in prisons and for returning citizens.","504",NA

"Expanding Long-Term Care Services and Supports","H",NA
"The COVID-19 pandemic exposed the vulnerabilities of people who reside in institutional settings, such as nursing homes and independent living facilities,","706",NA

"Remote instruction must be individualized to the greatest possible extent","506",NA
"and reasonable modifications should be provided for students with disabilities even during a pandemic.","506",NA
"The evidence from nearly two decades of education reforms that hinge on standardized test scores shows clearly that high-stakes testing has not led to enough improvement in outcomes for students or for schools,","506",NA
"and can lead to discrimination against students, particularly students with disabilities, students of color, low-income students, and English language learners.","503",NA

"Not only will these measures make it easier for Americans to buy a home or start a small business,","402",NA
"student debt forgiveness is key to helping address the racial wealth gap,","503",NA
"as students of color are more likely to have to borrow to finance higher education.","503",NA
"Democrats will also empower the CFPB to take action against exploitative lenders","706",NA

"The Trump Administration has let for-profit colleges and universities once again prey upon students with impunity by repealing important protections.","706",NA

"He has attacked the sources of our strength,","104",NA
"hollowed out American diplomacy,","105",NA
"shredded international commitments,","107",NA
"weakened our alliances,","104",NA

"Rather than make smart investments to keep our military’s competitive edge, President Trump has wasted billions on vanity projects,","104",NA
"barred patriotic Americans from serving their country,","104",NA
"denied military families the care and support they have earned,","104",NA
"and tried to use our women and men in uniform to sow fear and division.","104",NA
"Rather than help Americans compete in the global economy, he’s launched reckless, politically-motivated tariff wars","407",NA
"that have punished American workers,","701",NA
"antagonized our allies,","104",NA

"Rather than end our forever wars, he’s brought us to the brink of new conflicts,","105",NA
"and further militarized our foreign policy.","105",NA
"Rather than reduce nuclear dangers, he’s amplified them, and brought the world closer to catastrophe.","104",NA
"Rather than stand shoulder-to-shoulder with our allies and partners, he’s betrayed them.","107",NA
"Rather than defend democracy and human rights, he’s fawned over autocrats, sent love letters to despots, sided with dictators over peaceful protestors, and invited foreign interference in our elections.","202.1",NA
"Rather than root out corruption, he’s made common cause with kleptocrats.","304",NA
"Rather than fight the existential threat of climate change, he’s denied science and accelerated the damage.","501",NA

"Democrats believe four more years of Donald Trump will damage our influence beyond repair.","305.2",NA

"We must meet the world as it is today, not as it was before President Trump’s destruction.","305.2",NA
"That’s why we cannot simply aspire to restore American leadership.","601.1",NA

"We will ensure that our military has no peer.","104",NA
"We owe it to our men and women in uniform and to the American public to spend our defense dollars more wisely and strategically","104",NA

"Americans deserve better.","601.1",NA
"Rebuilding America’s Tool of First Resort","H",NA
"Democrats believe that diplomacy should be our tool of first resort.","105",NA
"The world’s greatest power deserves to have the world’s very best diplomatic corps.","105",NA

"Democrats will support and invest in long overdue reforms to make the State Department more strategic, modern, agile, and effective.","105",NA
"Rather than militarize our foreign policy, treat our diplomats with contempt, and call for reckless budget cuts, Democrats will put diplomacy back in the hands of professionals","105",NA
"and ensure they are better prepared to advance American interests on the central issues of our time, like disruptive technology and climate change.","105",NA
"We will recruit a new generation of Americans who want to serve their country abroad","105",NA

"Democrats believe America’s alliances are an irreplaceable cornerstone of our national security that should be cultivated, not cast away.","104",NA
"Our allies offer an enormous strategic advantage that our rivals can’t match.","104",NA
"They multiply our influence, spread our reach, lighten our burden, and advance our shared interests and priorities much farther than we could ever do on our own.","104",NA
"President Trump has undermined our alliances in ways that our adversaries could have only dreamed of—sowing doubts about our commitments to diplomatic agreements, mutual defense, democratic values, and strategic purpose.","104",NA
"As a result, our alliance system today faces its biggest test since the end of the Cold War.","104",NA
"He has pushed to bring Russia back into the G7","104",NA
"while lambasting our NATO partners","104",NA
"and ignoring intelligence about Russian bounties for killing American troops and other coalition forces in Afghanistan.","104",NA
"He has undermined confidence in America’s commitment to the alliance’s Article 5 mutual defense provision,","104",NA
"and threatened to pull troops out of Germany without consultation.","104",NA
"In the midst of a nuclear crisis on the Korean Peninsula, he tried to extort our South Korean allies to dramatically increase their share of alliance costs.","104",NA
"Democrats will not only repair our alliances, but reinvent them to advance mutual priorities and deal with new challenges.","104",NA
"We believe our alliances are strongest when they are rooted in shared democratic values.","202.1",NA
"That’s why we need to signal clearly our profound concerns about democratic backsliding in a number of ally states,","202.1",NA
"and why we need to work with allied democracies to end democracy’s global recession.","202.1",NA
"We will make developing shared responses to non-military threats like disinformation, corruption, and economic coercion, priorities in our agenda.","107",NA
"We will work with our partners to improve interoperability,","104",NA
"and we will encourage them to build up their defense capabilities,","104",NA

"We believe the system of international institutions we built and led over the past seven decades has generated an enormous return on our investment.","107",NA
"And in today’s more competitive world, its renovation is a critical diplomatic priority.","107",NA
"Unfortunately, President Trump has orchestrated an American retreat from global bodies that weakens our influence,","107",NA
"cedes ground to our adversaries,","104",NA
"and puts global peace and prosperity in jeopardy.","106",NA
"Instead of walking away, Democrats believe the United States should lead the way and mobilize our partners to work in common cause.","107",NA
"We will rejoin and reform the WHO,","107",NA
"the United Nations Human Rights Council,","107",NA
"and the United Nations Population Fund,","107",NA
"because in a global public health crisis and a global democratic recession, American leadership is needed more than ever.","601.1",NA

"With less than one percent of its annual budget, the United States gets an extraordinary return on its investments in the prevention and alleviation of poverty, hunger, disease, and conflict,","107",NA
"the empowerment of vulnerable and marginalized populations,","107",NA

"That’s why we will ensure that the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) reclaims its position as the world’s premier development agency.","107",NA
"And it’s why we reject the Trump Administration’s punitive and transactional approach to foreign aid","107",NA

"Ending Forever Wars","H",NA
"Democrats know it’s time to bring nearly two decades of unceasing conflict to an end.","106",NA
"Our military engagements, which have spanned from West Africa to Southeast Asia, have cost more than $5 trillion","105",NA
"and claimed more than half a million lives.","105",NA
"Our war in Afghanistan is the longest war in American history, with the youngest U.S. troops now fighting a war that was launched before they were even born.","105",NA
"President Trump said he would get the United States out of these wars, but instead he deployed more combat forces, expanded their missions,","105",NA

"Democrats will not only end the wars that have cost so much American blood and treasure—we will apply their lessons.","106",NA
"We will only use force when necessary to protect national security and when the objective is clear and achievable","104",NA

"and where warranted, the approval of Congress.","202.1",NA
"That is why we will work with Congress to repeal decades-old authorizations for the use of military force","105",NA
"and replace them with a narrow and specific framework that will ensure we can protect Americans from terrorist threats","104",NA
"while ending the forever wars.","106",NA
"Rather than occupy countries and overthrow regimes to prevent terrorist attacks, Democrats will prioritize more effective and less costly diplomatic, intelligence, and law enforcement tools.","105",NA

"Defense Spending","H",NA
